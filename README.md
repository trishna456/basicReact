## Features

This app covers the following features:

- **Components**: The UI is built using reusable components, allowing for a modular and maintainable structure.
- **JSX**: JSX syntax is used to describe the UI components in a declarative manner, making it easier to visualize the UI structure.
- **State Management**: State is managed within components to create interactive UIs. Events and user interactions trigger state updates, resulting in dynamic UI changes.
